I think its helpful to the user to apply tool tips to the form. I would have found it useful to have documentation in each click event specifically with the LINQ queries to understand their purpose at a glance. The code appears neat and concise, it doesn't appear to have any redundancies.
  There are no error handling for any of the user inputs so the program crashes anytime you click search without the proper input criteria. This could be fixed with try catch statements in each click event accompanied by error messages, I believe this would keep the program from crashing. 
  Our solutions differ in that I made it to where my user could only see the search criteria they were using. I think this makes my form appear more streamlined. I think this organization adds to the ease of use of my solution.
