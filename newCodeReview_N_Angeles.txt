Code Review for James :)

When converting user inputs (Convert.ToInt32 and Convert.ToDecimal), I think it is crucial to handle any unexpected exceptions. To make sure that the input is in the desired format (numeric), think about adding validation. If conversion fails, consider providing error messages that are easy to understand.

The author used 'ToLower()' to construct a case-insensitive search for the product description (searchProductDescriptionButton_Click). In order to guarantee a more inclusive search, this is a smart practice.

I have found that in my code, I chose to add a 'Clear' button, this really improves user experience. Users may quickly clear the search results or reset the form thanks to this functionality. I suggest including a "Clear" button to offer a comparable advantage in your implementation, given the favorable effect it has had in my version."
