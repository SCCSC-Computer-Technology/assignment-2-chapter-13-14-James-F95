This file program in the above folder is For chapter 14 Problems 4/5/6. 
The file opens and Problem 4 is solved by adding a gridview, a search textbox, and two buttons to search by product number or product description. I programmed both buttons to put information from the database and then display the results at the end.
Problem Five deals with the text boxes and search button below. This uses the amount of products on hand to pull in the data and sort it using what is entered and from lowest to highest amount. 
I also added the form load command which forces the datagrid to load in all the data once the form loads. 
Problem Six is the same as Problem five except the results deal with the price of the products.
I also did not do the form load command since i was using one form for the whole application. I think a better way to do this is I could have just done three different forms so that the screens were not overloaded. I also did not add and exit button which i could do if I update it.
